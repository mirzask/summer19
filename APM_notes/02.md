# Chapter 2

For **regression** problems where we try to predict a numeric value, the residuals are important
sources of information. A commonly used residual measure is RMSE. RMSE is interpreted as *how far, on average, the residuals are from zero.*

> Residuals are computed as the observed value minus the predicted value (i.e., $y_i - \hat{y_i}$). 

Assessing/estimating model performance:

1. Keep a separate "training" set and "test" set.
2. Resampling (e.g. CV, bootstrap) - i.e. different subversions of the training data set are used to fit the model

## Data Splitting

Ask yourself what the objective/use of the model will be? For instance, will the model be used to make predictions on the *same* population (**interpolation**) or on a *different* population (**extrapolation**)? This will influence the data splitting techniques.
