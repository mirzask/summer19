# Introduction to PyTorch

This tutorial is meant to serve as a gentle introduction to PyTorch.
There are two notebooks, an "Instructor" version with solutions to the exercises
and a "Student" version that has the exercises blank for you to fill in.

I hope you have fun learning about PyTorch and feel free to send me a message if there are any issues with the code.
